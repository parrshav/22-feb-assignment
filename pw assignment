Pandas basicAssignment Questions 
Assignment 
Q1. Create a Pandas Series that contains the following data: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42. Then, print the series.
import pandas as pd
series=[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
print_series=pd.Series(series)
print(print_series)
 
Q2. Create a variable of list type containing 10 elements in it, and apply pandas.Series function on the  variable print it. 
import pandas as pd
series=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
print_series=pd.Series(series)
print(print_series)

Q3. Create a Pandas DataFrame that contains the following data: 

Name 
Alice
 Bob
 Charlie
Bob  
Age 25 
30 

27 
Gender Female Male 
Female





































data={
    "NAME":["alice","charlie","bob"],
    "Age":[25,30,27],
    'Gender':['female','male','female']
}
df=pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)


Q4. What is ‘DataFrame’ in pandas and how is it different from pandas.series? Explain with an example. 
A DataFrame in pandas is a two-dimensional, tabular data structure, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. It consists of rows and columns, where each column can have a different data type
data={
    "NAME":["alice","charlie","bob"],
    "Age":[25,30,27],
    'Gender':['female','male','female']
}
df=pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
A Series in pandas is a one-dimensional labeled array. It is similar to a list or a one-column DataFrame. Each element in a Series has a corresponding label (called the index) that allows for fast and efficient data retrieval.
import pandas as pd
series=[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
print_series=pd.Series(series)
print(print_series)



Q5. What are some common functions you can use to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame? Can  you give an example of when you might use one of these functions? 
df['column']: Access a specific column in the DataFrame.
df[['col1', 'col2']]: Access multiple columns in the DataFrame.
df.drop('column_name', axis=1): Drop a specific column from the DataFrame.
df.drop(index_label): Drop a specific row from the DataFrame.
df.rename(columns={'old_name': 'new_name'}): Rename columns in the DataFrame.
df.groupby('column').mean(): Calculate the mean of grouped data.
df.groupby('column').sum(): Calculate the sum of grouped data.
df.groupby('column').count(): Count the occurrences in each group.
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Claire'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 27],
    'Grade': [85, 92, 78]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df['Age'].mean()
print(df)


Q6. Which of the following is mutable in nature Series, DataFrame, Panel? 
Among the options given, both Series and DataFrame are mutable in nature
Q7. Create a DataFrame using multiple Series. Explain with an example. 
series={
    'Number of students':[1,2,3,4,5],
    'name of teachers':['parshav','sushmita','muskan','nabeel','tanishka']
    
}  
df=pd.DataFrame(series)
print(df)
